	Currently, Liferay has excellent Eclipse support with the <a
	href="https://www.liferay.com/community/liferay-projects/liferay-ide/overview"
	target="_blank">Liferay IDE</a> and Liferay Developer Studio.
	However, as of this writing, Liferay has no official NetBeans
	plugins or IDE. So what are you to do if you want to develop on
	Liferay in NetBeans? Well you can run Liferay from the terminal of
	course, but what if you want to debug your code or Liferay's code or
	both? Remote debugging is the solution. Here's how you can do it
	with NetBeans:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
				Load up the source code for your project and
				(optionally) the <a
				href="https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal"
				target="_blank">source code for Liferay
				Portal.</a></li>
					<li>
							Set your
							breakpoints.</li>
								<li>
										In
										the
										terminal
										go
										into
										Tomcat's
										<code>bin/</code>
										directory:<br
										/>
												<pre>
												$
												cd
												$LIFERAY_HOME/tomcat-${version}/bin</pre>
													</li>
														<li>
																Execute
																the
																following
																command

$ cd $LIFERAY_HOME/tomcat-${version}/bin</pre>

	<li>
		Execute the following command to start up Tomcat in debug
mode:<br />
		<pre>
$ ./catalina.sh jpda start</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		In NetBeans attach a debugger to the running Tomcat by
selecting <em>Debug</em> -&gt; <em>Attach Debugger...</em> from the menu
bar.</li>
	<li>
		In the <em>Attach Debugger...</em> dialog (assuming that you
are using the default Tomcat settings) set the port to 8000 and click
<em>OK</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	After that, NetBeans should connect to the running Tomcat. Now you
are debugging Liferay on NetBeans.</p>
